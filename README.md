A landing page for a website

8/25/2022
The objective of this project is to practice HTML and CSS skills by creating a landing page for a website. This will help refresh my basic HTML skills and practice with the CSS skills that I've been learning. By the end of this project, I should be much more comfortable using flexboxes and should have a solid understanding of the HTML and CSS foundation.
