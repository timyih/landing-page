# landing-page
A landing page for a website

8/25/2022
The objective of this project is to practice HTML and CSS skills by creating a landing page for a website. This will help refresh my basic HTML skills and practice with the CSS skills that I've been learning. By the end of this project, I should be much more comfortable using flexboxes and should have a solid understanding of the HTML and CSS foundation.

Finished this project today. After completing this project, I definitely feel a good bit more confident in using flexbox. There were some things that I had to look up and things that I got stuck on for a while, but I feel like my overall skills have improved. Right now, the landing page is a just a copy of the provided reference, as I wanted to see how well I could imitate the reference just by using my own skills. I think I will now start the JavaScript lessons but I will try to find some time to edit this landing page so it looks more like a real landing page with content. School is also starting tomorrow so I will have less time, sadly.
